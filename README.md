Spotify Music Analysis using the Spotify API

Ideas:

# - Data Visualization (charts, graphs)
# - Top Genres Analysis DONE
# - Audio Features Analysis
# - Playlist Creation based off of listening habits
# - Shareable Results
# - Add more API calls to the dashboard view (e.g., top artists, recently played).
# - Create a new view and template to handle D3.js visualizations. The view would
#   return a JSON response of the data, and the template would use JavaScript
#   to fetch this JSON and render the charts.
# - Implement Django models to store the data permanently in your database,
#   so you don't have to re-fetch it from Spotify every time.
# - Improve the styling of your dashboard and visualizations.
# - Find a way to say how many times you have listened to your top tracks
# - implement a recently played section


Genre Charts needs to be cleaned up and documented
All .html and .js need to be cleaned up and documented
Views.py needs to be cleaned up and documented
Inspired by stats for spotify make it show 3 different time periods for top tracks (4 weeks, 6 months, 12 months) and you can select which you'd like to see. Do the same thing for artists and tracks and genres but use bar graphs for that. 
A recently played tracks thing would be cool as well and probably quite easy
MAKE IT LOOK VISUALLY APPEALING TO THE USER SO PRETTY MUCH HOW I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT IT.
