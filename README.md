Spotify Music Analysis using the Spotify API

Ideas:

# - Data Visualization (charts, graphs)
# - Top Genres Analysis
# - Audio Features Analysis
# - Playlist Creation based off of listening habits
# - Shareable Results
# - Add more API calls to the dashboard view (e.g., top artists, recently played).
# - Create a new view and template to handle D3.js visualizations. The view would
#   return a JSON response of the data, and the template would use JavaScript
#   to fetch this JSON and render the charts.
# - Implement Django models to store the data permanently in your database,
#   so you don't have to re-fetch it from Spotify every time.
# - Improve the styling of your dashboard and visualizations.
